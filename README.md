# Cosmic-Chaos

Cosmic Chaos is a Space-based modpack by Filostorm focused around [GTCEu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gregtech-ce-unofficial)
(gregtech community edition unofficial), technology, and exploration.

Start your journey in a failing space station where you'll progress through a steam-free ULV/early LV
and prepare to crash land a space ship on one of three planets to continue branching progression.
